            <p>Welcome to Odd Duck Fashions — where weird is wonderful, and fashion bites back (sometimes literally).</p>

            <p>We’re a small, delightfully offbeat brand that believes the best accessories aren’t just worn — they start conversations. From handmade gold and silver jewelry shaped like real human teeth to purses so strange they deserve their own fan clubs, Odd Duck Fashions is a love letter to the beautifully bizarre.</p>

            <p>Each piece we create is meant to make you stop, stare, and smile — because normal is overrated. Our tiny team of eccentric artists handcrafts every item with a dash of rebellion, a pinch of dark humor, and a whole lot of creativity. Whether it’s a pair of weirdly wonderful shoes or a glimmering molar pendant, every item in our collection celebrates individuality and unapologetic self-expression.</p>

            <p>At Odd Duck Fashions, we don’t follow trends — we hatch them.</p>

            <p>So, if you’ve ever felt like the odd one out, congratulations — you’ve found your flock.</p>
